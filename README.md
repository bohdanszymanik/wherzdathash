Geographic analysis of certain hashtags

Use https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/{tag}/media/recent to find recent media associated with a tag - we're particularly interested in the location and time data.

The apigee interface is pretty good: https://apigee.com/console/instagram but we'll write some code to graph outputs. There's a good R example to start from here: https://github.com/JulianHill/R-Tutorials/blob/master/r_instagram.r described by Julian in http://thinktostart.com/analyze-instagram-r/ .
